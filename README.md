# Internship_Demo_UI
Internship project demo by Devexpress. Project coming from another backend project and it is repos at my profile.

This is a front-end project for my intern. Designs is simple for my experience. Important point is connection and comminication to backend and Python Deep Learning Model. This 
project purpose is view the system result actually. I just had difficulties on convertion on this project and consume the api result and parsing JSON, because of my own 
production is unorthodox. Updates and changes will come on the near future.
